# Compound Liquidation Bot


___
Update, April 15 2021:
I've open-sourced a much better liquidation bot. See [here](https://github.com/haydenshively/Nantucket).

Update, November 27 2020:
Compound has changed significantly since this code was written. For those of you forking it,
please understand that it **will not** work out of the box. If you want it to be
remotely competitive, you should look into the following:

- Frontrunning
- V2 CTokens vs V1 CTokens, and how that impacts whether an account is liquidatable and what
assets should be repaid/seized
- Posting prices in the same transaction as the liquidation (only possible in a smart contract)

If you want additional resources, open an issue on the topic and I'll do what I can to help.

This repository provides web3 boilerplate and the basic logic
necessary to profitably call `liquidateBorrow()` on cToken smart
contracts.

I've chosen to make it open source in the spirit of
decentralization... and also because I no longer use it. I now call
`liquidateBorrow()` from within a flash loan contract, which requires
more gas (and therefore higher transaction fees). *As such, I cannot
profitably liquidate low-value (< 0.5 Îž) accounts. This code (sometimes) can.*

## Installation

```shell script
npm install
```

You can also use yarn if you wish.

## Usage

```shell script
node main.js
```

You will also need to create a `.env` file with the
following information:

- `PUBLIC_KEY` your wallet's address
- `PRIVATE_KEY` your wallet's private key (for signing txs)
- `COMPOUND_ENDPOINT` https://api.compound.finance/api/v2
- `ETHPLORER_ENDPOINT` https://api.ethplorer.io
- `GAS_STATION_ENDPOINT` https://ethgasstation.info/json/ethgasAPI.json
- `WEB3_PROVIDER` could be Infura, your own node... anything

If you want to run this in Docker or on Google Cloud Platform,
I'm going to assume you know what you're doing. Configuration
files are available.

## How it works

Compound provides two very useful services: the Account
Service and the cToken Service. These services provide
information about all users and currencies currently on
the protocol. The code in `/compound/API.js` fetches and
processes this information before handing it off to
`main.js`.

`main.js` also has handlers that retrieve data about current
gas prices, close factors, the liquidation incentive, and
your wallet balance (for each token).

With all of that information in hand, it's easy to determine
whether a given user can be profitably liquidated. In pseudocode,
the idea is this:

```js
const user; // Item from array returned by AccountService API

let bestAssetToRepay = null;
let bestAssetToSeize = null;
let maxRepayable_Eth = 0.0;
let maxSeizable_Eth = 0.0;

user.tokens.forEach(token => {
  const repayable_Eth = token.borrowBalanceUnderlying * costInEth * closeFactor;
  const seizable_Eth = token.supplyBalanceUnderlying * costInEth / liquidationIncentive;

  if (
    repayable_Eth > maxRepayable_Eth &&
    seizable_Eth > maxSeizable_Eth
  ) {
    if (repayable_Eth <= maxSeizable_Eth) {
      // In this case, raising maxRepayable_Eth actually increases rewards
      // (maxSeizable_Eth is sufficient to maximize liquidation incentive)
      maxRepayable_Eth = repayable_Eth;
      bestAssetToRepay = token;
    } else {
      // In this case, raising maxRepayable_Eth wouldn't lead to increased rewards
      // so we increase maxSeizable_Eth instead
      maxSeizable_Eth = seizable_Eth;
      bestAssetToSeize = token;
    }
  } else if (repayable_Eth > maxRepayable_Eth) {
    maxRepayable_Eth = repayable_Eth;
    bestAssetToRepay = token;
  } else if (seizable_Eth > maxSeizable_Eth) {
    maxSeizable_Eth = seizable_Eth;
    bestAssetToSeize = token;
  }
  
  const amount = Math.min(maxRepayable_Eth, maxSeizable_Eth);
  const profitability = amount * (liquidationIncentive - 1.0);
  if (profitability > txFee && user.liquidity < 0) {
    bestAssetToRepay.liquidateBorrow(user.address, amount, bestAssetToSeize);
  }
});
```
